# Machine Learning CS4641
## Assignment1
## Project: Iris Classification and Wine Classification

### Install

The pre-installed packages are already included in the Pre-installation file, the most import several packages include the following

# This is to install the scikit-learn into the computer
$ pip install -U scikit-learn
# This is to install pybrain
git clone git://github.com/pybrain/pybrain.git
$ python setup.py install

$ pip install pydotplus
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [csv](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet

It is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

### Data

Since this assignment has two problems that we need to solve, so we have two csv files in the files.
wine.csv and iris_data.csv

### Scripts

You should run all the scripts one by one in the terminal to get the sample output. 

There are five scripts in the folder, used to run different classification algorithms.
Decision_tree.py
Neural_Network_iris.py
Gradient-Boosting.py
SVMs.py
k-nearest-neighbors.py

##Notice!!!

All the scripts are used to just run one problem, need to do some modification before conduct all of the problems.
Which means it just generate some example about how the execuation results look like, not all the output values.
